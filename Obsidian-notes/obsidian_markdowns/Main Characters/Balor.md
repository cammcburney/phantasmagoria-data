# --CHARACTER--
![[Balor_ref_1.png|300x300]]
Balor is part of the [[Dì-chòirichte Aiteam]], a race of people subjugated by the Sìthiche Dubh.
Throughout the game Balor often remains quiet with little to say, however, is often seen performing compassionate actions towards those less fortunate.

Balor is well regarded in [[Taigh Geamhraidh]], villagers often comment on their consideration of others and dedication to the village and it's tasks.

Balor's gender, characteristics and past are never referred to throughout the game. It is intentionally left ambiguous.


# --STORY--
Balor is considered one of the leading [[Protagonists]]until later where they are found to be one of the [[Antagonists]] at a pivotal point when they revive the monstrous machine buried underneath [[Taigh Geamhraidh]], the [[Gread Aingeal Tuiteamach]]. This is considered to be Balor's true intention throughout the game.

Balor is killed early on by Sile and revived by Oda in Taigh Geamhraidh. This fuels their anger and hatred even further. 

Balor massacres the capital city of [[Sìthiche Dubh]], innocents and guilty alike, many other innocent races reside there who are in better standing with the afformed. This is done as an act of vengeance for the [[Dì-chòirichte Aiteam]] and other races enslaved by the [[Sìthiche Dubh]]. However, the princess is found earlier in the game to wish for the freedom of all captured races, although she is powerless at the time to do so and wouldn't be able to for many years. This signifies the death of hope within the game, the cycle of violence continues as the Queen remains alive unbeknownst to Balor. It is a meaningless act of tragedy.

TBC(?)
The event causes the [[Reul Shiùbhlach Mòr-sgor]] when Balor accidentally destroys a reserve of [[Rèidio-beò Gealadh]] causing a rift to open between the physical and divine realms unleashing a further race, the Diadhaich_Anail.


A pivotal boss fight occurs against Balor commanding the [[Gread Aingeal Tuiteamach]], the
player may choose to kill Balor, invite them back to the party or allow their freedom in which they become an NPC for the remainder of the game and return to the village and their home and no longer speak to any character or move. 

If they are invited back to the party eventually they shown signs of regret for their actions. 

# --WEAPONARY--
Balor is equipped with mining missles which create a controlled blast and a cutting dagger infused with Reidio-beo Geladh.
