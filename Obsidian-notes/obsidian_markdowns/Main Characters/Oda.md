# --CHARACTER--
![[Oda_ref_1.png|650x425]]
Oda is  a young woman from the people of  [[Neach-àiteachaidh de Cliathach Beinne]],
Oda is part of the [[Nèamhaidh Grèim]] along with her sister [[Sile]] and the daughter of Ordained Minister.

Odds personality is harsh and disciplinarian, her firm rooted beliefs and values in religion and expected behaviours are meant to grate the audience to begin with, a classic unlikeable character.

However, throughout the events of the game that personality wavers and takes a turn by the end to be more compassionate through lived experience, seeing the suffering of the world and the impact religion has changes her direction as an individual. 

Oda saves Balor early in the game after they are killed by Sile, this can be considered one of Odas first signs of changing as a person. 

A key part of Oda’s story is fighting against her sister [[Sile]], the  first fight is due to her disgust at Balor accompanying Oda however the fights become more serious as Oda defects from the [[Nèamhaidh Grèim]]. Sile represents everything monstrous about the actions of the faction to the point until she becomes a monster herself, hellbent on stopping Oda, even going so far as to consume a lesser god after the [[Reul Shiùbhlach Mòr-sgor]].
