# --CHARACTER--
Sile (Sheila) is one of the leading [[Antagonists]] and a [[Boss]] fought multiple times. She is also known as 'Onn Nèamhail Claidheamh' (the heavenly/celestial sword)

Sile is the petty and vindictive older sister of [[Oda]] of whom she looks down upon. She serves to be an embodiment of all Oda’s negative traits and of evil itself. 

Sile is considered the strongest warrior of the [[Nèamhaidh Grèim]]. She is effortless in her attacks and outmatched in strength and speed. She is significantly taller than most humanoid beings and possesses near superhuman strength 
# --STORY--
Sile’s malice becomes ever stronger throughout the game, she carries a vendetta against Oda for breaking the oath sworn as part of being in the [[Nèamhaidh Grèim]] and for defecting from her devout religious views.

Sile kills Balor early in the game, fuelling their silent hatred. 

As the game progresses Sile’s obsession with hunting Oda and her companies becomes her sole focus, her own insecurities and weaknesses manifest in hatred to the point she becomes a monster from abusing Reidio-beo Gealeadh injections to gain strength

Sile is infatuated by the idea of what [[Irbhinn]] achieves in his lab, the strength from his own mutation is what she desires most to the point she becomes a mutated monstrosity. 
This is furthered by her consuming a lesser god after being defeated in a later fight and near death to achieve her final form before eventually being killed toward the end of the game by Oda (necessity in the party for the fight).

# --WEAPON--
She possesses  greatly oversized sword (lol)
