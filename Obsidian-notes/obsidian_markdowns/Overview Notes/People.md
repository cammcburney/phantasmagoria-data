The people of the world of Phantasmagoria are meant to be a mix of characteristics of all people, the world is set in a fictitious representation of England. 

I want to avoid portraying people as being from ‘foreign lands’ and avoid stereotypes games tend to fall into particularly for non white characters. All the characters are from the same land, albeit different parts. 

Despite this, I would like to try and make all the characters have relatable characteristics for everyone in small and subtle ways rather than in overt ones. Everyone has a place in this game but you shouldn’t be able to put a finger on a stereotype rather certain moments and characteristics should be related to. (Sorry weird concept and idea to explain, I don’t want things to be overt or alienating)
