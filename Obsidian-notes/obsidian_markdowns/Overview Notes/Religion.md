I want the religious aspects of the game to remain somewhat mysterious, when the realm of gods merges with that of man I want concepts like the holy whisper to be both physically present in the wandering lesser gods who have cacophonous whispers however still leaving it open to interpretation as with real world religions, you simply cannot tell what the truth is and but an idea can seem like reality whether it is or isnâ€™t.  There is sometimes seemingly an explanation but nothing is definite.
