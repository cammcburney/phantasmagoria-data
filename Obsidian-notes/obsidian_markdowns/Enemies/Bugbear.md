A tough [[Enemy]] encountered
Found in [[Crann Bethadh Mòr-choille]]

Middle English word _bugge_. This _bugge_ was used for all kinds of imaginary spooky creatures—from ghosts and goblins to scarecrows—that cause fright or dread. In the 1500s this _bug_ was combined with _bear_ (as in the animal) to form _bugbear_, even though there is little evidence that either a _bug_ or _bugbear_ took an ursine form. In fact, based on its earliest known uses, _bugbear_ began as an all-purpose word for things that cause fear or dread, not just supernatural beasties.
