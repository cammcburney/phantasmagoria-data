Etymology: Disqualified folk

a race of people subjugated by the [[Sìthiche Dubh]] and "transfigured" using machine and arcane magic into
living machines to serve menial tasks such as farming, mining, manufacturing.

The [[Dì-chòirichte Aiteam]] often refer to [[Sìthiche Dubh]] as "baoth sìogaidh" (foolish, simple, vapid: fairy)
